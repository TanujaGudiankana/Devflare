# DevFlare – Bootstrap 5 UI

A modern, responsive multi-page website built with Bootstrap 5 (CDN). It composes polished pages by remixing official components: navbars, carousel/hero, cards, forms, accordion, and utilities.

## Pages
- `index.html` – Home with navbar, hero carousel, features, cards, CTA, footer
- `about.html` – About/Services with value cards, FAQ accordion, team
- `contact.html` – Contact form (Netlify-ready), map, CTA

## Tech
- HTML5, CSS3
- Bootstrap 5 (CDN) + Bootstrap Icons
- Optional hosting: GitHub Pages or Netlify

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder (e.g. VS Code Live Server). No build step required.

## Deploy
### GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository and push this folder
2. In Repository Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/root`
3. Your site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`

### Netlify
- Drag-and-drop this folder to Netlify, or connect the GitHub repo
- The contact form uses Netlify Forms. Ensure at least one successful deploy for the form to register
